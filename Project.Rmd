## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

p <- 0.7
n <- 26
x <- 0:n
y <- dbinom(x, size = n, prob = p)
df <- data.frame(x, y)

# Create the bar plot using ggplot2
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      geom_col(fill = "#5DA5DA", color = "#252525") +
      labs(title = "Binomial Distribution with p = 0.7 and n = 26", x = "Number of Successes", y = "Probability") +
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"), 
            axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
            axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
            plot.title.position = "plot")

options(repr.plot.width = 18, repr.plot.height = 8)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
